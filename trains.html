        <label class="info"
          >The Venice Simplon-Orient-Express (VSOE) is the world’s most
          authentic luxury train. Made famous in the Agatha Christie story, the
          train’s 1920s-vintage Art Deco cars, sparkling in their navy and gold
          livery and snowy white roof, take your breath away. The journey
          between Paris and Istanbul is legendary — and perfect for special
          occasion celebrations.</label

          >Suites — new in 2023 — offer en-suite bathroom and shower, either
          double or twin beds (2 Suites are configured with twin beds, 6 are
          configured with double bed), and small sitting area. Beds will be
          converted into a banquette seating area during the day. Suites also
          come with bath amenities, kimono, and slippers.

        Grand Suites add considerable comfort — at a hefty price. The train has
        six Grand Suites, each measuring approximately 115 square feet. Grand
        Suites have a double bed (can also be made into two twins), separate
        living area with table, chair and sofa, and an en-suite bathroom with
        shower, sink and toilet. The Grand Suites are named “Paris”, “Venice”,
        “Istanbul”, “Prague”, “Vienna”, and “Budapest”. Each has a unique decor,
        to emphasize the distinctive aspects of each destination.

        <label class="info"
          >There are three gorgeous dining cars: one, “Étoile du Nord,” mainly
          with marquetry; another, “L’Oriental,” with Chinese lacquered walls
          with bright animals; and a third, “Côte d’Azur,” with Lalique crystal
          insets.

      </article>
      <section>
        The dining experience is five-star both in food quality/variety and
        service. One of the reasons is that people are not all seated at the
        exact same time. Instead, seatings are staggered. This allows the staff
        to properly welcome and serve each diner.

          >The Post Track, a prehistoric causeway in the valley of the River
          Brue in the Somerset Levels, England, is one of the oldest known
          constructed trackways and dates from around 3838 BCE, making it some
          30 years older than the Sweet Track from the same area. Various
          sections have been designated as scheduled monuments.</label

        Evidence indicates that there was a 6-to-8.5-kilometre long (3.7 to 5.3
        mi) Diolkos paved trackway, which transported boats across the Isthmus
        of Corinth in Greece from aro und 600 BCE. Wheeled vehicles pulled by
        men and animals ran in grooves in limestone, which provided the track
        element, preventing the wagons from leaving the intended route. The
        Diolkos was in use for over 650 years, until at least the 1st century
        CE. Paved trackways were also later built in Roman Egypt.

        The line originally used wooden rails and a hemp haulage rope and was
        operated by human or animal power, through a treadwheel.[9] The line
        still exists and remains operational, although in updated form. It may
        be the oldest operational railway.

        Wagonways (or tramways), with wooden rails and horse-drawn traffic, are
        known to have been used in the 1550s to facilitate transportation of ore
        tubs to and from mines.

        In the late 1760s, the Coalbrookdale Company began to fix plates of cast
        iron to the upper surface of wooden rails, which increased their
        durability and load-bearing ability. At first only balloon loops could
        be used for turning wagons, but later, movable points were introduced
        that allowed passing loops to be created.
      </section>
      <section>
        A system was introduced in which unflanged wheels ran on L-shaped metal
        plates – these became known as plateways. John Curr, a Sheffield
        colliery manager, invented this flanged rail in 1787, though the exact
        date of this is disputed.[who?] The plate rail was taken up by Benjamin
        Outram for wagonways serving his canals, manufacturing them at his
        Butterley ironworks. In 1803, William Jessop opened the Surrey Iron
        Railway, a double track plateway, sometimes erroneously cited as world's
        first public railway, in south London.
